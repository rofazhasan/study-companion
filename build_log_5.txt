Warning: Flutter support for your project's Android Gradle Plugin version (Android Gradle Plugin version 8.2.1) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Android Gradle Plugin version to a version of at least Android Gradle Plugin version 8.6.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's AGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (/Users/md.rofazhasanrafiu/coding/study_companion/android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version. In this case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (/Users/md.rofazhasanrafiu/coding/study_companion/android/build.gradle) by the following line in the dependencies block of the buildscript: "classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:<version>'".

Warning: Flutter support for your project's Kotlin version (1.9.0) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Kotlin version to a version of at least 2.1.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (/Users/md.rofazhasanrafiu/coding/study_companion/android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version, in which case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (/Users/md.rofazhasanrafiu/coding/study_companion/android/build.gradle) by the ext.kotlin_version property.
