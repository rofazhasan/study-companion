# Llama Models Directory

Place your Llama model files here:

1. **chat_model.gguf** - Your Llama chat model (e.g., Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct)
2. **embedding_model.gguf** - Your embedding model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

The app will automatically detect and use these models.

## Model Recommendations

- **Chat Model**: Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf (~800MB)
- **Embedding Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2-Q4_K_M.gguf (~25MB)

## Note
These files are not included in the repository due to their large size.
Download them from Hugging Face and place them here before building the app.
